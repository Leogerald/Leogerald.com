        <h1>Look back in Anger-<b><i>Written by John Osbourne.</i></b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <b><i>Look Back in Anger (1956)</i></b> is a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/realist" target="_blank">realist</a> play written by John Osborne. It focuses on the life and marital struggles of an intelligent and educated but disaffected young man of working-class origin, Jimmy Porter, and his equally <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/competent" target="_blank">competent</a> yet <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impassive" target="_blank">impassive</a> upper-middle-class wife Alison. The supporting characters include Cliff Lewis, an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amiable" target="_blank">amiable</a> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/welsh" target="_blank">Welsh</a> lodger who attempts to keep the peace; and Helena Charles, Alison's <a href="https://www.webster.com/dictionary/snobbish" target="_blank">snobbish</a> friend.[3][4][5]

            Osborne drew inspiration from his personal life and failing marriage with Pamela Lane while writing Look Back in Anger, which was his first successful outing as a playwright. The play <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spawned" target="_blank">spawned</a> the term "angry young men" to describe Osborne and those of his generation who employed the harshness of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/realism" target="_blank">realism</a> in the theatre in contrast to the more <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/escapist" target="_blank">escapist</a> theatre that characterised the previous generation.[6] This harsh realism has led to Look Back in Anger being considered one of the first examples of kitchen sink drama in theatre.
            
            The play was received favourably in the theatre community, becoming an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enormous" target="_blank">enormous</a> commercial success, transferring to the West End and Broadway, and even touring to Moscow. It is credited with turning Osborne from a struggling playwright into a wealthy and famous personality, and also won him the Evening Standard Drama Award as the most promising playwright of 1956. The play was adapted into a motion picture of the same name by Tony Richardson, starring Richard Burton and Mary Ure, which was released in 1959. Film production credited circa 1958.[7][8]

        <h3><b><i><u>Background</u></i></b></h3>
        <p>
            Written in 17 days in a deck chair on Morecambe Pier,[9][10] Look Back in Anger was a strongly autobiographical piece based on Osborne's unhappy marriage to actress Pamela Lane and their life in cramped accommodation in Derby.[11] While Osborne aspired towards a career in theatre, Lane was more practical and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/materialistic" target="_blank">materialistic</a>.[citation needed] It also draws from Osborne's earlier life; for example, the <a href="https://meriam-webster.com/dictionary/wrenching" target="_blank">wrenching</a> speech of witnessing a loved one's death was a replay of the death of his father, Thomas.
            What it is best remembered for, though, are Jimmy's <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tirades" target="_blank">tirades</a>. Some of these are directed against generalised British middle-class <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smugness" target="_blank">smugness</a> in the post-atomic world. Many are directed against the female characters, a very distinct echo of Osborne's uneasiness with women, including his mother, Nellie Beatrice, whom he describes in his autobiography A Better Class of Person as "hypocritical, self-absorbed, calculating and indifferent".[12] Madeline, the lost love Jimmy pines for, is based on Stella Linden, the older rep-company actress who first encouraged Osborne to write.[citation needed] After the first production in London, Osborne began a relationship with Mary Ure, who played Alison; he divorced his first wife (of five years) Pamela Lane to marry Ure in 1957.

        <h3><b><i><u>Production</u></i></b></h3>
        <p>The play was premiered at London's Royal Court Theatre, on 8 May 1956 by the English Stage Company under the direction of Tony Richardson, setting by Alan Tagg, and music for songs by Tom Eastwood. The press release called the author an "angry young man", a phrase that came to represent a new movement in 1950s British theatre. Audiences supposedly gasped at the sight of an ironing board on a London stage.[13]

            The cast was as follows: Kenneth Haigh (Jimmy), Alan Bates (Cliff), Mary Ure (Alison), Helena Hughes (Helena Charles) and John Welsh (Colonel Redfern). The following year, the production moved to Broadway under producer David Merrick and director Tony Richardson. Retaining the original cast but starring Vivienne Drummond as Helena, it would receive three Tony Award nominations including for Best Play and "Best Dramatic Actress" for Ure.

        <h2><i><u>Major Characters and their Roles.</u></i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Jimmy Porter:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jimmy Porter is the play's main character. He is the "Angry Young Man” who expresses his frustration for the lack of feelings in his placid domestic life. Jimmy can be unders ood as both a hero for his unfiltered expressions of emotion and frustration in a culture that propagated unemotional resignation.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Allison Porter:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Alison is basically a well-bred person who refuses to stoop to Jimmy's level to retaliate on his provocation. She fondly embraces the responsibility and tradition of her upbringing. She keeps faith in an orthodox morality. However, she married Jimmy against her parents wishes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Helena Charles:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Helena is Alison's friend, a very proper middle-class woman. She is an actress who comes to stay with the Porters while she performs in a play at the local theatre. Jimmy has long despised her, as he considers her a member of the Establishment.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cliff Lewis:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cliff is Jimmy' s friend and partner in the candy stall business and shares the Porters' flat, although he has his own bedroom across the hall. Cliff is a poorly educated, working class man of Welsh heritage. He is warm, loving, and humorous. He genuinely loves Alison but adjusts when she leaves and Helena moves in.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Colonel Redfern:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He is Alison's father who shatters the traditional image of upper-class members and projects a new concept about their nature. His attitude towards his daughter, Alison, and Jimmy has poignantly realized, when he has given several very thought-provoking speeches after he arrived at Porter's house.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2><b><i><u>PLOT: ACT 1</u></i></b></h2>
        <p>Act 1 opens on a dismal April Sunday afternoon in Jimmy and Alison's cramped attic in the Midlands. Jimmy and Cliff are reading the Sunday papers, plus the radical weekly, "price ninepence, obtainable at any bookstall" as Jimmy snaps, claiming it from Cliff. This is a reference to the New Statesman, and in the context of the period would have instantly signalled the pair's political preference to the audience. Alison is attempting to do the week's ironing and is only half listening as Jimmy and Cliff engage in the expository dialogue.

            It becomes apparent that there is a huge social gulf between Jimmy and Alison. Her family is upper-middle-class military, while Jimmy belongs to working class. He had to fight hard against her family's disapproval to win her. "Alison's mummy and I took one look at each other, and from then on the age of chivalry was dead," he explains. We also learn that the sole family income is derived from a sweets confectionary stall in the local market—an enterprise that is surely well beneath Jimmy's education, let alone Alison's "station in life".
            
            As Act 1 progresses, Jimmy becomes more and more vituperative, transferring his contempt for Alison's family onto her personally, calling her "pusillanimous" and generally belittling her to Cliff. (Some actors play this scene as though Jimmy thinks everything is just a joke, while others play it as though he really is excoriating her.) The tirade ends with physical horseplay, resulting in the ironing board overturning and Alison's arm getting burned. Jimmy exits to play his trumpet off stage.
            
            Alison, alone with Cliff, confides that she's accidentally pregnant and can't quite bring herself to tell Jimmy. Cliff urges her to tell him. When Jimmy returns, Alison announces that her actress friend Helena Charles is coming to stay, and Jimmy despises Helena even more than Alison. He flies into a rage.</p>
         <br>
         <h2><b><i><u>ACT 2</u></i></b></h2> 
         <p>
            Act 2 opens on another Sunday afternoon, with Helena and Alison making lunch. In a two-handed scene, Alison says that she decided to marry Jimmy because of her own minor rebellion against her upbringing and her admiration for Jimmy's campaigns against the dereliction of life in postwar England. She describes Jimmy to Helena as a "knight in shining armour". Helena says, firmly, "You've got to fight him".

            Jimmy enters, and the tirade continues. If his Act 1 material could be played as a joke, there's no doubt about the intentional viciousness of his attacks on Helena. When the women put on hats and declare that they are going to church, Jimmy's sense of betrayal peaks. When he leaves to take an urgent phone call, Helena announces that she has forced the issue. She has sent a telegram to Alison's parents asking them to come and "rescue" her. Alison is stunned but agrees that she will go.
            
            The next evening, Alison's father, Colonel Redfern, comes to collect her to take her back to her family home. The playwright allows the Colonel to come across as quite a sympathetic character, albeit totally out of touch with the modern world, as he himself admits. "You're hurt because everything's changed", Alison tells him, "and Jimmy's hurt because everything's stayed the same". Helena arrives to say goodbye, intending to leave very soon herself. Alison is surprised that Helena is staying on for another day, but she leaves, giving Cliff a note for Jimmy. Cliff in turn hands it to Helena and leaves, saying "I hope he rams it up your nostrils".
            
            Almost immediately, Jimmy bursts in. His contempt at finding a "goodbye" note makes him turn on Helena again, warning her to keep out of his way until she leaves. Helena tells him that Alison is expecting a baby, and Jimmy admits grudgingly that he's taken aback. However, his tirade continues. They first come to physical blows, and then as the Act 2 curtain falls, Jimmy and Helena are kissing passionately and falling on the bed.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h2><b><i><u>ACT 3</u></i></b></h2>
         <p>
            Act 3 opens as a deliberate replay of Act 1, but this time with Helena at the ironing-board wearing Jimmy's Act 1 red shirt. Months have passed. Jimmy is notably more pleasant to Helena than he was to Alison in Act 1. She actually laughs at his jokes, and the three of them (Jimmy, Cliff, and Helena) get into a music hall comedy routine that obviously is not improvised. Cliff announces that he's decided to strike out on his own. As Jimmy leaves the room to get ready for a final night out for the three of them, he opens the door to find Alison, looking like death. He snaps over his shoulder "Friend of yours to see you" and abruptly leaves.

            Alison explains to Helena that she lost the baby (one of Jimmy's cruellest speeches in Act 1 expressed the wish that Alison would conceive a child and lose it). The two women reconcile, but Helena realises that what she's done is immoral and she in turn decides to leave. She summons Jimmy to hear her decision and he lets her go with a sarcastic farewell.
            
            The play ends with a sentimental reconciliation between Jimmy and Alison. They revive an old game they used to play, pretending to be bears and squirrels, and seem to be in a state of truce.
